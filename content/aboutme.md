I am a nerd and I have always been a nerd.  I grew up messing with computers,
mostly just playing video games though, nothing productive of course.  I dabbled
with Linux here and there but I never really did much practical work on the computer.
Finally when I went to High School at the
[North Carolina School of Science and Math](http://www.ncssm.edu), I got the
chance to take some programming classes and fell in love.

I wasn't completely sold on Computer Science as a career field though - I still
really liked physics, and Engineering sounded very appealing -  so when I went
on to the [Rose-Hulman Institure of Technology (RHIT)](http://www.rose-hulman.edu)
for undergrad, I decided to
pursue a Computer Engineering major. This was definitely one of the best
decisions I've ever made, because it exposed me to DSP, Communications, and
Software-Defined Radio.  The whole field seemed like a perfect combinaation
of Math, Physics, and Computer Science, and I couldn't get enough of it.

After graduating from RHIT in the Spring of 2011 I took a job with n~ask, a
small defense contractor that specializes in DSP work, and I've been there ever
since.  I am also working on my Master's of Electrical Engineering at the
Virginia Tech Northern Virginia Center (VT NVC), which I hope to finish by the
end of 2014.

In my free time I do a number of different things.  At some point during
undergrad I decided that a sedentary lifestyle was a bad idea and I should try
to be at least a little bit active,
so I got into running.  I've been running pretty consistently ever since and I've
run in several races, including a few Half Marathons (not a full yet, but
someday!).  I never really stopped playing video games either. These days I've
gotten really into [Kerbal Space Program](http://kerbalspaceprogram.com), to the
point that it's pretty much all I play, but every once in a while I'll play
something else with college buddies, as a way to catch up.

And I also like to work on side projects just for fun. I created this site
as a way of showcasing these [projects](../projects/).  Unfortunately, in recent years, I
haven't had much time for these projects - it's just too hard to fit them in
between work, school, and running.  Hopefully as school wraps up I'll be able
to start working off my list of project ideas again in earnest.

Oh, and if you're interested, here's a [resume](../media/resume.pdf).
