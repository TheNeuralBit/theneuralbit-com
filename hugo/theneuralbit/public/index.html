    <div class="entry-content">Javascript is single-threaded.
I hear that all the time, but I think people&rsquo;s interpretation of it is often an oversimplification. That statement is true within a single browser tab, but there are plenty of ways to get that browser to thread for you:
 Asynchronous I/O (AJAX or FileReader). The browser handles all the details of this for you, but at the end of the day it&rsquo;s doing some kind of multi-threading to handle the request, so your browser tab can do other work in the meantime.</div>

    <div class="entry-content">If you&rsquo;re anything like me, the only times you&rsquo;ve ever used git stash it went something like this: In the middle of working on branch A you decided you should test something out on branch B. So you quickly run git stash, checkout branch B and test something, then come back to branch A, run git stash apply and pick back up where you left off.
Well it turns out git stash is much more powerful than that, and we&rsquo;ve all been missing out for years.</div>

    <div class="entry-content">The name of this website is an anagram. It&rsquo;s possible to rearrange all of the letters in the neural bit to form brian hulette. That&rsquo;s a simple concept I set out to illustrate concisely with the site&rsquo;s logo.
For the first iteration of this webpage, way back when I was in late high school and early college (ca. 2007), I just pulled up the Gimp, which I had probably learned to use just the previous week, and drew up the following image.</div>
