This site was adapted from my old, pure HTML website.  My old site was beginning
to get too large to be maintainable.  The biggest problem I had was the lack of
separation between content and style.  Whenever I wanted to make a change to the
site's appearance, I had to open up every single page and edit the relavant HTML
while leaving the content alone.

I started to look into alternatives and I found [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/).
Jekyll is a blogging framework that allows you to write the content of the
site in markdown, completely separated from the style, which is written with
HTML and CSS templates.

I quickly went to work converting all of my old HTML pages to markdown and
writing templates for the website style.
