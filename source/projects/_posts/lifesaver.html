So this one wasn't very creative.  There was a post on the <A HREF="http://www.makezine.com">Make blog</A> about putting a clock in a circular tin so I decided to do it.  I went out and bought some lifesavers and a clock, then ate the lifesavers and gutted the clock.  The only real work I had to do was drill a hole in the top of the tin and shave off the corners of the clock a little bit to slip it inside.
